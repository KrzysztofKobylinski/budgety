# budgety
## My second app made in JavaScript, based on Udemy Course.

### Functionality:

* User is able to add incomes and expenses. 
* App is calculating monthly budget based on those items.
* When User is adding/deleting item, app updates budget.
* UI is dynamic(for example: colors of active fields are based on type of item(income = blue, expense = red).
* Bonus: Background image is generated randomly (pictures from picsum.photos).
